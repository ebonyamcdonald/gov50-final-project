## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to... voter turnout?

```{r}
library(haven)
data <- read_sav("Data/W110_Jun22/ATP W110.sav")
```


I am interested in understanding the effect of co-ethnic representation on voting behavior. Specifically, I would like if Black Americans are more likely to vote in elections if a candidate on the ballot is also Black. I hypothesize that there will be greater voter turnout in elections where there is a black candidate on the ballot. In past research, I have learned that oftentimes, there is a greater level of trust among same-race political representatives and their constituents, which also further promotes civic engagement among black Americans (Claudine Gay - Spirals of Trust? The Effect of Descriptive Representation on the Relationship between Citizens and Their Government). In this case, the explanatory variable is the existence of a black candidate in an election, and the outcome variable is voter turnout. My hypothesis could be proven if I found that elections with black candidates on the ballot had a greater voter turnout than elections with non-black candidates.
